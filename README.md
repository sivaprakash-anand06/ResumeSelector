üìÑ Resume Processor API
A FastAPI application that processes PDF resumes using a Language Model (LLM) like OpenAI's GPT, compares them against a provided job requirement, and generates an Excel file with structured analysis.

‚ú® Features
Upload one or more PDF resumes.

Provide a text description of your job requirement.

Uses an LLM to analyze resumes and extract key information:

Name

Years of Experience

Key Strengths

Summary

Fit for the Role (Y/N)

Overfit for the Role (Y/N)

Returns a downloadable Excel (.xlsx) file with the results.

üõ†Ô∏è Internals
FastAPI: Web framework.

Pandas: For generating Excel sheets.

OpenAI (or compatible LLM client): To extract structured data from resumes.

Concurrency: Uses asyncio to handle multiple uploads efficiently.

Security: API keys should be set via environment variables.

üìå Notes
LLM Client: The code assumes usage of OpenAI's API. Replace the client initialization if you are using a different LLM provider.

File Size Limit: Make sure your LLM can handle large base64-encoded PDFs or preprocess them accordingly.

Format Expectation: The LLM is expected to return a dictionary with specific keys in its response.

Example required dictionary format:

python
Copy
Edit
{
  'NAME': 'John Doe',
  'YEARS OF EXPERIENCE': '5',
  'KEY STRENGTHS': ['Python', 'Data Analysis'],
  'SUMMARY': 'Experienced data analyst...',
  'SUITABLE FOR MY REQUIREMENT (Y/N)': 'Y',
  'OVERFIT (Y/N)': 'N'
}
üßπ Future Improvements
Add OCR/Text extraction before sending to LLM for better token efficiency.

Implement retries/backoff for LLM API failures.

Add authentication for production deployments.

Improve error reporting with detailed logs.
